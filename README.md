📚 What I Learned

This project was created for fun and to strengthen my understanding of game development fundamentals.
Along the way, I also explored key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles like:

    Clean and modular code structure

    Encapsulation of logic

    Reusable components to manage complexity
