Alien Invasion

Alien Invasion is a basic 2D shooter game I created using Pygame. It's a simplified version of classic space shooter games where the player controls a ship and must shoot down waves of aliens.
Features

    Player-controlled spaceship that moves left and right

    Aliens that descend from the top of the screen

    Bullet shooting mechanics to destroy incoming aliens

    Basic collision detection

    Score tracking and game over state

Technologies Used

    Python

    Pygame

How to Run

    Make sure you have Python installed.

    Install Pygame using: pip install pygame

    Run the game with: python alien_invasion.py

Notes

This project was made for fun and learning purposes while exploring the basics of game development with Pygame.
It also helped me apply foundational Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, modular design, and organizing code into reusable components to keep the game structure clean and manageable.
